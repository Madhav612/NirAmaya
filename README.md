# NirAmaya
NirAmaya is a health alert system that can use the available relevant information about the factors responsible for the spread of viral epidemics and use it to predict the occurrence of those epidemics within a geographical region. It provides the interface through which health organizations can report viral epidemics occurring at that time so that public health experts can prepare for, manage and control the epidemic.
